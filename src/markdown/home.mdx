Hi, I'm ppvan. I'm a self-taught backend engineer, which means I work behind the scenes on one or many websites. I also write automation scripts to make my work more efficient.

Currently, I'm studying for a bachelor's degree at the University of Science and Technology (UET). In my free time, I enjoy learning more about Linux so I can use it more effectively (I'm use Arch, btw).

I feel most comfortable programming in Java or Python, but I'm also happy to work with C and Rust. My knowledge of front-end development and server administration allows me to create interesting projects (such as this website!). I'm also interested in learning more about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
